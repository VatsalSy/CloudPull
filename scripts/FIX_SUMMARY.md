# Pre-commit Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deprecated Stage Names
- **Issue**: The `push` stage was deprecated in pre-commit
- **Fix**: Changed `stages: [push]` to `stages: [pre-push]` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

### 2. golangci-lint Installation Error
- **Issue**: Pre-commit couldn't download golangci-lint for ARM64 macOS
- **Fix**: Changed golangci-lint hook from remote repository to local system installation
- **Configuration**: Modified to use `language: system` instead of `language: golang`

### 3. PATH Configuration
- **Issue**: Installed tools weren't found in PATH
- **Fix**: Updated scripts to include Go and Ruby bin directories in PATH

## Changes Made

### 1. `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Fixed deprecated stage name: `push` → `pre-push`
- Changed golangci-lint to use system installation
- Consolidated local hooks into one section

### 2. `scripts/setup-dev.sh` (NEW)
- Consolidated functionality from install-hooks.sh and install-test-deps.sh
- Installs all development tools (golangci-lint, gosec, pre-commit, etc.)
- Sets up pre-commit hooks
- Added PATH exports for Go and Ruby binaries
- Improved error checking and feedback

### 3. `scripts/fix-precommit.sh` (NEW)
- Created a helper script to fix pre-commit issues
- Installs missing dependencies
- Cleans pre-commit cache
- Reinstalls hooks with proper configuration

## Current Status

✅ All pre-commit hooks are now properly configured
✅ golangci-lint is working (found code issues, which is normal)
✅ No more deprecation warnings
✅ Tools are accessible in PATH during hook execution

## Linting Issues Found

The golangci-lint tool found several code quality issues:
- Unchecked error returns
- Cognitive complexity warnings
- Unused variables/parameters
- Line length violations
- Various style issues

These are normal findings and can be addressed separately.

## Next Steps

1. **To run all hooks manually**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

2. **To fix linting issues automatically** (where possible):
   ```bash
   golangci-lint run --fix
   ```

3. **To add PATH permanently** (optional):
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(ruby -r rubygems -e "puts Gem.user_dir")/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## Tools Installed

- ✅ pre-commit
- ✅ golangci-lint v1.55.2
- ✅ gosec
- ✅ markdownlint (mdl)
- ✅ shellcheck

All tools are properly configured and working with the pre-commit hooks.
